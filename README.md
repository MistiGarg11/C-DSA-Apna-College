# C++ DSA - Apna College 🚀

This repository contains my **C++ DSA practice files** from the **Apna College DSA Series**.  
I will upload lecture-wise code as I learn.
I am keeping **one `.cpp` file per lecture**, and inside it I may include multiple programs (with some `main()` functions commented).

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each lecture will have its own file with related programs:
HelloWorld.cpp ← Lecture 1
lec2.cpp ← Lecture 2
---

## 🎯 Goals
- Learn **C++ fundamentals**
- Master **DSA concepts step by step**
- Stay consistent with uploads 🚀

---

## ⚡ How to Run
```bash
g++ HelloWorld.cpp -o output
./output
